description: Run pytest tests with coverage reporting
---

Run the project's test suite using pytest:

1. Execute `pytest` with coverage reporting enabled
2. Show test results with verbose output
3. Display coverage summary
4. If any tests fail, analyze the failures and provide recommendations
5. Check if any new code lacks test coverage

Run tests in parallel when possible using pytest-xdist for faster execution.
