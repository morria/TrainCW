description: Create a new module with proper structure and tests
---

Help me create a new module in the TrainCW project.

Ask me:
1. What is the module name?
2. What is the module's purpose?
3. What functionality should it provide?

Then:
1. Create the module file in the appropriate location under `src/traincw/`
2. Add comprehensive docstrings and type hints
3. Follow the project's coding standards (ruff, mypy)
4. Create corresponding test file in `tests/`
5. Add basic unit tests
6. Update `__init__.py` if needed to export public APIs
7. Run tests to verify everything works

Ensure the new code:
- Follows PEP 8 and project style guide
- Has proper error handling
- Includes usage examples in docstrings
- Integrates well with existing modules
